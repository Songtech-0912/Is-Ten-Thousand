# Python Is-Ten-Thousand

My mockery of the is-ten-thousand npm module - so that python always gets the last laugh :)

> Please don't get too angry, I only mean this as a joke to JS devs. And I am one myself.

## Usage

Is-Ten-Thousand is so simple, even a wonky JavaScript developer can use it:

```
from isTenThousand import isTenThousand
isTenThousand(3) # any random number here
```

And just to make sure we don't degenerate into JavaScript developers, it has type-checking, too!

```
# Try doing this...
isTenThousand("This is definitely a number") # any random non-int/float type
# ...and embarrass yourself with the result
>>> Come on, you're a python dev! Don't make silly mistakes like those Javascript weirdos!
```
